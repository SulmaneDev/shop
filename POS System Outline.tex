\section{Summary}
The POS System is a web-based Point of Sale application designed to streamline retail operations for mobile and accessories businesses. It provides a robust interface for managing suppliers, creating purchases, handling product templates, and maintaining customer data, all optimized for a web environment. The system is built using Laravel to ensure a scalable and efficient solution, with plans for future enhancements to include customer-facing features and reporting tools.

\section{Objective}
The primary objective is to develop a web-based POS system that enhances retail management for mobile and accessories stores by providing advanced features for supplier management, purchase processing, and product tracking. The application aims to deliver an efficient platform for internal staff, with future support for customer interactions, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.

\section{System Architecture}
The system architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, optimized for a web-based environment. It comprises the following components:

\subsection{Web Application}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed using Laravel with Blade templating for a responsive web interface.
    \item Supports optional integration of Vue.js or Alpine.js for enhanced interactivity.
    \item Communicates with the backend server for data processing and storage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend Server}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built with Laravel to handle business logic and data management.
    \item Ensures data security and integrity through robust authentication and encryption.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilizes MySQL or PostgreSQL to store user profiles, product templates, supplier data, customer information, and purchase records.
    \item Designed for scalability with efficient indexing and querying.
\end{itemize}

\section{Modules and Features}
The application is structured into several key modules to support retail operations:

\subsection{User Authentication}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure login and registration for admin, user, and future customer roles.
    \item Role-based access control to manage permissions for different user types.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product Template Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manage product templates without IMEI or variant data.
    \item Support for basic product details and categorization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brand Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CRUD operations for brand data to organize product offerings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supplier Management}
